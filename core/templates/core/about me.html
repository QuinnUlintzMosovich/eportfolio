<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>By Quinn Ulintz Mosovich</h2>
<p>I, Quinn Ulintz Mosovich, and a 9th grader attending ESUMS, an engineering and science high school. My desire to go to ESUMS stemmed from my love for engineering. Specifically, I am very passionate about aerospace engineering. I am also very curious about chemistry and philosophy. However, my primary interest is in the aerospace field. My interest in aerospace, and subsequent interest in aviation, has led me to develop a  hobby in learning about aircraft and the forces that govern their motion. My passion for engineering has also led me to create machines from LEGOS, such as crossbows or cars. These creations are something that I am quite proud of, and they give me a sense of accomplishment whenever I look at them. In addition, I am quite proud of the knowledge that I have gathered, an achievement in itself. The things that I have created and the knowledge I have gathered inspire me to learn more, make more, and do more out of school related to engineering. My desire to learn more about engineering and my passion for knowledge lead me to consider a future that would combine all of these interests and create a future right for me in the field of aerospace engineering.</p>
